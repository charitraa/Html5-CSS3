                Conclusion
            </div>
            <p> In conclusion, technology has both positive and negative impacts on society. While technology has made
                life easier in
                many ways, it has also created new problems.

                While there are clear benefits to the advancement of technology, we must also be aware of the possible
                implications of
                its use.
                Technology is there in everyoneâ€™s life. It affects you emotionally, physically, mentally, and
                environmentally.
                Technology makes the world a better place. It gives us the freedom to live in a better way and helps
                make our life easy.
                Technology helps in better communication, treatment of diseases, has helped reached space, and wherever
                you look around,
                it is there. It not only helps develop the present but also the future. Technology thus is an essential
                part of our
                lives and will also be the same, as it will be evolving day by day.
                It enhances the usefulness of goods and services and helps in creating value. It helps make any work
                easier and helps us
                in multiple ways. Technology has both positive and negative effects. Many people use it for their
                growth, and some use
                it to harm society and the ecosystem.
                Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life or, as it is
                sometimes
                phrased, to the change and manipulation of the human environment.
                The purpose of technology is to meet a human need or solve a human problem. Technology can help meet
                many types of human
                needs, like needs of shelter, food, clothing, and communication. Technology does not originate from the
                natural world
                and includes methods or activities that people use to alter their environments.
                Over time, technology will enable financial stability and discipline without the need for people to gain
                relevant
                knowledge. AI and machine learning advisors will become ubiquitous, constantly recommending the next
                gig, next
                investment or next online class to us, truly democratizing growth and financial wellbeing.
