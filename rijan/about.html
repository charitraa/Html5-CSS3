            <strong> T</strong>echnology is the application of knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproducible
            way. The
            word technology
            can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,including both tangible tools such as utensils or
            machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays a critical role in science,
            engineering, and everyday
            life.

            Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is
            the stone tool,
            used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the
            human brain and
            the development of language during the Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed
            greater travel and
            the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the printing
            press, telephone,
            and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.

            While technology contributes to economic development and improve human prosperity, it can also have
            negative impacts
            like pollution or resource depletion, or may cause social harms like technological unemployment
            resulting from
            automation. As a result, there are ongoing philosophical and political debates about the role and use of
            technology, the
            ethics of technology, and ways to mitigate potential downsides.
            Technology is a term dating back to the early 17th century that meant 'systematic treatment' (from Greek
            Τεχνολογία,
            from τέχνη 'art, craft' and -λογία, 'study, knowledge').It is predated in use by the Ancient Greek
            τέχνη, used to
            mean 'knowledge of how to make things', which encompassed activities like architecture.

            Starting in the 19th century, continental Europeans started using the terms Technik (German) or technique
            (French) to
            refer to a 'way of doing', which included all technical arts, such as dancing, navigation, or printing,
            whether or not
            they required tools or instruments. At the time, Technologie (German and French) referred
            either to the
            academic discipline studying the "methods of arts and crafts", or to the political discipline "intended to
            legislate on
            the functions of the arts and crafts. Since the distinction between Technik and Technologie is
            absent in
            English, both were translated as technology. The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred
            to the
            academic discipline, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

            In the 20th century, as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution, technology
            stopped being
            considered a distinct academic discipline and took on its current-day meaning: the systemic use of knowledge
            to
            practical ends.
